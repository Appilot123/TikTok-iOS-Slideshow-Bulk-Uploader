<h1 align="center">Tiktok iOS Slideshow Bluk Uploader</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project automates the bulk uploading of TikTok photo slideshows — with music selection — across 100+ iOS-based accounts. Unlike typical video uploaders or PC schedulers that trigger the dreaded “0 views” bug, this tool mimics human-like behavior on iOS, bypassing shadowbans and algorithmic throttling. Ideal for creators, marketers, and agency-scale operators who want hands-off slideshow publishing with maximum reach and organic engagement.


## Core Features:
- **iOS-Centric Posting:** Avoids Android-based shadowbans by simulating uploads through iOS frameworks.
- **Slideshow & Music Support:** Specifically built for photo carousel uploads with user-defined audio, not just basic video posts.
- **Multi-Account Scaling:** Deploy posts across 100+ TikTok accounts with rotating proxies and session isolation.
